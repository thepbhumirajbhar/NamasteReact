two types of import/export
1. default export/import
2. named export/import: uses { <component_name> }

# React hooks
- normal JS utility functions given to us by React.
- need to be imported from "react" like a named import.  
- Two MOST IMP hooks: 1. useState(): used to generate super powerful State variables in react.
                      2. useEffect()
- the second paramenter (eg: setListOFRestaurants) is used to update the list. The list can not be updated directly.
